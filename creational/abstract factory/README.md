## Description
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Implementation
In this example, we have an `AbstractFactory` class that has two methods, `createProductA` and `createProductB` that return `ProductA` and `ProductB` objects respectively. We have two subclasses of `AbstractFactory` class, `ConcreteFactory1` and `ConcreteFactory2` that override the `createProductA` and `createProductB` methods to return `ConcreteProductA1`, `ConcreteProductB1` and `ConcreteProductA2`, `ConcreteProductB2` objects respectively.

## When to use
Use the Abstract Factory pattern when your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.

## Benefits

- You can be sure that the products you’re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
- You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can separate the product creation code from the client code.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

## Drawbacks

- The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.

## Example
```typescript
const factory1 = new ConcreteFactory1();
const productA1 = factory1.createProductA();
const productB1 = factory1.createProductB();
productA1.usefulFunctionA(); // Output: The result of the product A1 collaborating with the product B1

const factory2 = new ConcreteFactory2();
const productA2 = factory2.createProductA();
const productB2 = factory2.createProductB();
productA2.usefulFunctionA(); // Output: The result of the product A2 collaborating with the product B2
```

## Relations with Other Patterns
- Abstract Factories are often based on a set of Factory Methods, but you can also use Prototype to compose the methods on these classes.
- Abstract Factory classes are often implemented with Factory Methods, but they can also be implemented using Prototype.
- You can use Abstract Factory along with Bridge. This pairing is useful when some abstractions defined by Bridge can only work with specific implementations. In this case, Abstract Factory can encapsulate these relations and hide the complexity from the client code.
- You can use Abstract Factory along with Builder. This pairing is useful when you need to create different representations of an object.
- You can use Abstract Factory along with Prototype to create a factory that produces prototypes instead of objects.
- You can use Abstract Factory along with Singleton. The Singleton pattern can be applied to the factory classes.

## Applicability
Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:
- a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- a system should be configured with multiple families of products.
- a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
- you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.
